# SimulatedMazeSearching
This project uses the generalized adaptive A* search algorithm developed by Sven Koenig in order to perform repeated fast-trajectory planning.  This search algorithm uses information from previous searches in order to inform future ones, therefore making each subsequent search increasingly more efficient.  The search uses the heuristic properties of the normal A* algorithm but makes it more consistent.  For more information on the algorithm itself or to read Koenig's research paper on the topic, see the information below:
